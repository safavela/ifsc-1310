  <h3>My Thoughts on Web Assessibility</h3>
  <p>
Web assessibility is important for every and all users across the web. Webs should be easy to navigate 
and easy to connect with. There are many people with disabilites or people that simply don't have a lot
of experience with technology. For example, there should be an option for a voice narrator on every site 
for users that can't read or just have a dificult time with smaller text, or there could be an option for 
bigger text. Websites should also try to be language friendly. I've seen some websites recently add 
language options and even translators to help those with language barriers.
